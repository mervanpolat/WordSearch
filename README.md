# WordSearch

Welcome to the WordSearch app! This application was developed out of my passion for Java's multithreading capabilities. It efficiently searches for specific words within a given text and calculates their occurrences. By default, the application uses 'War and Peace' by Leo Tolstoy as its text source, but users have the freedom to change this as desired.
