# WordSearch

Welcome to WordSearch app! I built this application because I'm fascinated by Java's multithreading feature, and I wanted to create an app which efficiently searches for a specific word from a given text and calculates its occurence. The default text is 'War and Peace' by Leo Tolstoy. You're free to change the text source as you wish.
